Prepare DEMs to be loaded into Elmer

If you want the entire domain: 
exported csv containing XY coordinates of outline of domain. Get this from QGIS using "Polygon to Line" and QChainage around the geopackage of domain in ../DEMs/hubbard_outline.gpkg. 

If you want just the ice: 
Create a shape file with the desired domain. Export as csv as xy. 

If you want different boundaries: 
Use gmsh plug in QGIS to get geo file and make the rest. 


s0 -  Convert csv file from QGIS to dat file containing just XY coordinates
s1 - make geo file from dat file and use geo file to create msh file using gmsh 
s2 - Run ElmerGrid to make elmer mesh
