Prepare DEMs to be loaded into Elmer

s1 -  Subset surface DEM (ifsar) to hubbard outline using hubbard_outline geopackage
s2 - Crop thickness from full RGI of SC AK to just hubbard polygon
s3 - Smooth thickness to remove surface artifacts
s4 - subtract thickness from surface to get bed 
s5 - Reformat bed and surface DEM to text file elmer can read 

If you want to use a beddEM from icebridge data instead of Milan, then run s0 and then s5. 
s0 - crop tif to geopackage and reproject
